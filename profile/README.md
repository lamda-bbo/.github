## Welcome to LAMDA-BBO Group ðŸ‘‹

We are the LAMDA-BBO (Black-Box Optimization) group, led by Professor [Chao Qian](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/qianc/). Our group is a part of [LAMDA Group](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) @ Nanjing University, which is led by Professor [Zhi-Hua Zhou](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/index.htm). 

Our research focuses on advancing the theories, algorithms, and applications of black-box optimization. Our key areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Theoretical analysis of evolutionary algorithms
- Designing safe evolutionary algorithms, i.e., evolutionary algorithms with provable approximation guarantee
- Designing efficient black-box optimization algorithms, e.g., Bayesian optimization, evolutionary strategies, evolutionary gradient optimization, cooperative coevolution, and learning to optimize
- Evolutionary learning, particularly evolutionary reinforcement learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning
- Applications to solve real-world complex optimziation problems, e.g., in wireless network, electronic design automation, and geoscience
