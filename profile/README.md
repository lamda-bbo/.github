## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is LAMDA-BBO group, led by Associate Professor [Chao Qian](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/qianc/). We are also the members of [LAMDA Group](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/MainPage.ashx) @ Nanjing University, led by Professor [Zhi-Hua Zhou](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.People.ashx). 

We are dedicated to scientific research in theories, algorithms, and applications of black-box optimization, including but not limited to:

- Theoretical analysis of evolutionary algorithms
- Designing safe evolutionary algorithms, i.e., evolutionary algorithms with provable approximation guarantee
- Designing efficient black-box optimization algorithms, e.g., Bayesian optimization, evolutionary strategies, evolutionary gradient optimization, cooperative coevolution, and learning to optimize
- Evolutionary learning, particularly evolutionary reinforcement learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning
- Applications to solve real-world complex optimziation problems, e.g., in wireless network, electronic design automation, and geoscience
